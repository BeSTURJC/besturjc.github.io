Juan Carballeira obtained the degree in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in Electronics and Automation in 2014 from the University of Vigo. Subsequently, a Master's in Robotics and Automation was completed at the Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M), where a Ph.D. in Electrical, Electronic, and Automation Engineering was also earned in 2022 with a thesis titled "Global Localization based on Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms for Indoor and Underground Environments," during which a predoctoral stay was undertaken at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).

During those years, active collaboration with the Robotics Lab research group (UC3M) took place, participating in publicly funded R&D projects, primarily the Tuñel project focused on the automation of the drilling and blasting cycle in underground environments and the HERIOTEA project for the development of a mobile manipulator to assist the elderly.

Research focuses on localization, mapping, navigation, and control of mobile manipulators, as well as the application of optimization algorithms in various aspects of mobile robotics.

Since January 2023, part of the Electronic Technology area at the Rey Juan Carlos University as a Visiting Professor, collaborating with the Bioengineering Technologies and Systems (BeST) research group and primarily teaching in the field of control and automation systems.
