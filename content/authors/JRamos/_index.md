Jaime Ramos is a PPI Researcher in the Department of Applied Mathematics, Materials Science and Engineering and Electronic Technology at Rey Juan Carlos University in which he is developing his PhD in Implementation and evaluation of a new robotic paradigm for gait rehabilitation based on reinforcement learning. His interests are focused on the development and utilization of robotic systems for the rehabilitation and assistance of impaired patients from the technical and clinical perspectives and the study of the biomechanics of motor control.

He received his formation at the Technical University of Madrid and Politecnico di Milano, where he obtained a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, respectively.
