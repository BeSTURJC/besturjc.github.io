Álvaro García López received his PhD in Industrial Engineering (2022, MH Cum Laude), Industrial Engineering with specialisation in automation and electronics (2016) and Industrial Technical Engineering with specialisation in industrial electronics (2010), all from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M). He is currently working as an Assistant Professor at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.

His professional experience is focused on the metrology and quality control of electronic instrumentation in the areas of RF and electrical, temperature, pressure, dimensional, flow, mass, force and optics, in companies such as AFC Ingenieros, Indra, Mipel and Rohde & Schwarz, where he has worked as a calibration engineer, and also in the railway sector in Patentes Talgo, as a technical office engineer R+D+I, in CESyA and UC3M. This work has been carried out in laboratories and customer facilities, both nationally and internationally. These functions also involved development and research tasks focused on the improvement of the procedures used and the quality of the company's systems. In addition, given his experience, he also played a significant role in training his colleagues.

In terms of teaching experience, as an associate professor in the Department of Electronic Technology at UC3M, he taught in the undergraduate subjects of Fundamentals of Electronic Engineering, Power Electronics, both since 2020, and Industrial Electronics, since 2021; and in postgraduate courses in Electronic Systems and Industrial Instrumentation, of the Master's Degree in Industrial Engineering, until 2023. He currently teaches as Assistant Professor Doctor in the Electronic Technology Area of the URJC in Audiovisual Systems Architecture.

Parallel to his professional activity, he initiated his research career with his doctoral thesis, developing devices to improve accessibility to the performing arts for people with sensory disabilities. His research has been awarded The Annual Excellence in Doctoral Research Award at the iSCSi 2023 conference and the Dependencia y Sociedad Fundación Caser Awards in the R+D+i category (2022) for his participation in Accessible subtitling of film music. This multidisciplinary research was made possible through collaboration between researchers from diverse fields such as engineering, computer science, applied communication, and psychiatry, as well as different universities like UC3M and the Complutense University of Madrid. To date, he has published five articles in JCR-indexed journals in the first three quartiles, two book chapters, edited one book, and served as the editor of another book. He has participated in nine scientific congresses or conferences, contributed to four research projects related to electronic instrumentation and photonic technologies, and is co-author of one software registration.
