Álvaro García López received his PhD in Industrial Engineering (2022, MH Cum Laude), Industrial Engineering with specialisation in automation and electronics (2016) and Industrial Technical Engineering with specialisation in industrial electronics (2010), all from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M). He is currently working as a Doctoral Assistant at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M). 

His professional experience is focused on the metrology and quality control of electronic instrumentation in the areas of RF and electrical, temperature, pressure, dimensional, flow, mass, force and optics, in companies such as AFC Ingenieros, Indra, Mipel and Rohde & Schwarz, where he has worked as a calibration engineer, and also in the railway sector in Patentes Talgo, as a technical office engineer R+D+I, in CESyA and UC3M. This work has been carried out in laboratories and customer facilities, both nationally and internationally. These functions also involved development and research tasks focused on the improvement of the procedures used and the quality of the company's systems. In addition, and given his experience, he also presented a high training component to his colleagues. He is currently working as Assistant Professor at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.

In terms of teaching experience, as an associate professor in the Department of Electronic Technology at UC3M, he has taught in the undergraduate subjects of Fundamentals of Electronic Engineering, Power Electronics, both since 2020, and Industrial Electronics, since 2021; and in postgraduate courses in Electronic Systems and Industrial Instrumentation, of the Master's Degree in Industrial Engineering, until 2023. He currently teaches as Assistant Professor Doctor in the Electronic Technology Area of the URJC in Audiovisual Systems Architecture.

In parallel to her professional activity, she has been able to start her research activity with her doctoral thesis, developing devices to improve accessibility to the performing arts for people with sensory disabilities, awarded with The Annual Excellence in Doctoral Research Award at the iSCSi 2023 conference and Dependencia y Sociedad Fundación Caser Awards in the R+D+i category (2022) for her participation in Accessible subtitling of film music. This research, completely multidisciplinary, was possible thanks to the collaboration between researchers from very diverse fields, such as engineering, computer science, applied communication and psychiatry, and different universities such as UC3M and the Complutense University of Madrid. To date, he has published 5 articles in JCR indexed journals in the first 3 quartiles, 2 chapters in books, the edition of 1 book and editor of 1 book. He has participated in 9 scientific congresses or conferences of various kinds, participated in 4 research projects related to electronic instrumentation and photonic technologies and is co-author of 1 software registration.
