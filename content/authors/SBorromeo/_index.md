Susana Borromeo holds a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Madrid, where she began her professional career developing digital electronic systems in the Electronic Engineering Division of UPM.

In 2004, she joined the Bioengineering and Medical Imaging group at the Rey Juan Carlos University. From 2007 to 2013, she was part of the Medical Image Analysis Laboratory at the CIEN Foundation - Queen Sofia Foundation (Alzheimer Project), where she developed the electronic instrumentation line for neuroimaging and led the line on olfaction as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases using imaging techniques.

Between 2009 and 2011, she was Head of the Digital Circuit Design and Electronic Technology Laboratory of the Madrid I+D Laboratory Network, where several electronic systems based on wireless communications were developed in various fields of application such as health and disability. In 2012, she joined the "Medical and Health Engineering" Commission of the Official College of Industrial Engineers of Madrid as a member. Since October 2016, she has also been a member of the Teaching Commission of the Industrial Engineering Commission of the Official College of Industrial Engineers of Madrid (COIIM). In February 2017, she joined the University, Training, and Employment Committee of the Institute of Engineering of Spain. Since January 2018, she has held the position of treasurer of the IEEE Spain Section Instrumentation and Measurement Society Chapter.

Over the years, she has participated in 20 R&D projects funded by public calls, being the principal investigator in five of them. She has also participated in more than 30 R&D contracts with companies and hospitals, highlighting the Team Cell project through the Madrid-MIT M+Visión scientific collaboration consortium between entities of the Community of Madrid and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In addition to the articles referenced in the Web of Science and her participation in more than 40 conferences, she is co-inventor of 2 patents, 1 of which is in exploitation, and 4 software registrations. Notable technology transfer products include two commercial products, two real-time cardiac signal recording devices using Bluetooth technologies that have obtained FDA certification and CE marking.
