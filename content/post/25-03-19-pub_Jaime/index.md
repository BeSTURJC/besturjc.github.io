ðŸš€ Revolutionizing Rehabilitation with Robotic Devices ðŸ¤–

<!--more-->

Our group has just published an innovative review on robotic devices that enable body weight support with assistance in the lower limbs. This is the first time these devices have been categorized and comparatively analyzed! ðŸ“Šâœ¨

These devices represent a crucial opportunity for the transition from stationary robotic devices to robotic exoskeletons for walking therapy. Additionally, they are essential for aiding and rehabilitating key components of gait, such as weight shifting and the safe induction of perturbations during lower limb movement. ðŸ¦¿ðŸ’ª
