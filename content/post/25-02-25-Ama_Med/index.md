Our colleague Antonio J. del Ama Espinosa recently participated in the IV SEMEG Conference on Falls, organized by the Spanish Society of Geriatric Medicine. This event provided an excellent opportunity to establish new and exciting contacts with geriatric doctors, paving the way for impactful collaborations aimed at improving the quality of life for the elderly. 🧓👵✨

During the session on #Innovation, moderated by Dr. María Ángeles Caballero Mora and Dr. Marta Neira Alvarez, Antonio shared his engineering perspective on how technologies based on #ArtificialVision 👁️, #Robotics 🤖, and #Wearables ⌚, combined with #AI 🧠, can aid in the diagnosis and prevention of falls. The subsequent debate highlighted the need for:

    Enhanced collaboration between engineering and clinical fields to advance and implement new technologies. 🤝
	
    Developing devices that can gather more and better data, ideally during activities outside the clinic, to achieve a real impact of the Technology-AI duo in this area. 📊

Antonio expressed his gratitude to the Spanish Society of Geriatric Medicine and especially to Dr. Marta Neira Alvarez for the invitation. 🌟
